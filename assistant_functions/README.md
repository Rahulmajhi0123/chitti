This directory contains functions for different actions the assistant can perform. 

Below, there are additional instructions for some actions.

# Weather
Weather data is accessed using [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). To use the weather functionality of the assistant, you will need to sign up for weather API access using [this link](https://openweathermap.org/api). The free plan is sufficient for the assistant.

Once you have signed up for an API key, copy and paste it into a file called `weathertoken.txt` in the root directory of the project (not in the `assistant_functions` directory). If you installed the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file, the weather functionality should now work.
